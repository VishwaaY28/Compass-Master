POLICY FOR MANAGING RESERVE TALENT
SCS
1. DEFINITION
1.1. RESERVE TALENT
Technical skilled consultant (outside of those in sales and marketing and support) who is not generating revenue for Hexaware is considered to be a Reserve Talent. This means the consultant is not being billed for their work/effort daily to customers of Hexaware. A technical consultant in Hexaware can be marked as reserve talent for various reasons
A
Deployable pool — They are not billed on any project ina client engagement but are available for deployment either in the global competency or in the vertical or in the service line.
e
Designated Non-billable (DNB) - They (Grade G9 and above) are designated as Non-Billable (DNB) due to the role/nature of work of the consultant for eg ASDMs, SDMs, Competency leaders etc. A list of baselined DNB consultants will be maintained by the TMG Head and consultants can be included in this list only after necessary justification and approval from the TMG Head
e
e Pipeline — They are currently not in a client project but are selected by an account. The start date is a few weeks away due to which such consultants are marked as earmarked for projects.
e Investment/Internal projects - They are working for Internal/Investment projects of Hexaware for eg consultants in the GenAl Competency or in the Innovation Lab. Some of them may get partially billed to client projects as well.
e Non-deployable pool - They are ona sabbatical or long leave due to medical or other reasons in the non-deployable pool
e Unbilled in Accounts - They are working for a billable engagement with customer, however the consultant cannot be billed for a specific duration as they need training, knowledge transition or any other reason agreed with the customer like a contractual buffer in an engagement
The reserve talent (outside of Sales & Marketing and G &A ) can be in Global competency, Vertical competency, Vertical delivery, Service line delivery, Internal/ Investment Projects and in Accounts/Projects as unbilled consultants.
This document intends to cover the rules for managing the reserve talent highlighting the different scenarios as described above, after considering the specific nuances of each scenario to define the policy that best fits Hexaware’s and the consultants’ need and ensures that Hexaware can maximize the opportunity for consultants to help them get deployed and billed in the shortest possible timeframe.
